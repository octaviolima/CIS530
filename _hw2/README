to run this program, simply change the different constants to run certain algorithms 

INFERENCE: type of inference method used
BEAM_K: k for the beam_k algorithm 
GREEDY_BI: whether or not greedy is using bigrams
SMOOTHING: which smoothing method to use
LAPLACE_FACTOR = the amount to add when doing the add k algorithm
LAMBDAS = the lambdas for the linear interpolation algorithm

then run the file pos_tagger.py by using "python starter-code/pos_tagger.py" and change the file in the evaluate function on line 464 to either train dev or test.
